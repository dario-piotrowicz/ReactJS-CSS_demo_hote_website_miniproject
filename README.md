# Demo Hotel Miniproject

This is a simple miniproject I'm doing following a course on HTML & CSS ( [Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) by Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-html-css-from-the-beginning/) ).

The miniproject looks very basic and simple but I wanted to code along anyway, but to make it more interesting I decided to add a little challenge to myself, that is to implement the project using ReactJs (which I'm currently studying).

Just Implementing the project as a standard Create-React-App project would be quite trivial as all the components are presentational so I decided to try to implement it without CRA.
Actually I decided to implemting without even using JSX ( which [is not a react requirement](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html) ), WebPack, Babel and all that makes a standard React Application.

I just wanted to include the react library in the project and see if/how usable it is by itself ( many often say that React is just a library, not a framework, though technically true I find that assertion way oversimplistic, so I decided to take it literally and see how well the library fares without any of the standard settings ).

Other aspects I'd like to mention are:
 - In the course flexbox (or grid) has not been introduced yet, so the project is going to use floats instead (not a great practice but it is still worth knowing how it works)
 - All UI Designs and HTML/CSS are taken from the course and I'm coding along, so that is not designed by me, what is completely mine are the files structure and the javascript/react
