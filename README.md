# Demo Hotel Miniproject

This is a simple miniproject I'm doing following a course on HTML & CSS ( [Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass) by Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-html-css-from-the-beginning/) ).

The miniproject looks very basic and simple but I wanted to code along anyway, but to make it more interesting I decided to add a little challenge to myself, that is to implement the project using ReactJs (which I'm currently studying).

Just Implementing the project as a standard Create-React-App project would be quite trivial as all the components are presentational, so I decided to try to implement it without CRA.\
Actually I decided to implemting without even using JSX ( which [is not a react requirement](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html) ), WebPack, Babel and all that makes a standard React Application.

I just wanted to include the react library in the project and see if/how usable it is by itself.\
Many often say that React is just a library, not a framework, though technically true I find that assertion way oversimplistic, so I decided to take it literally and see how well the library fares without any of the standard settings.\
I must actually pleasantly surprised to find out that the library by itself is very much usable and although it makes for a quite verbose javascript code I did not find major issues with that. (Also using react in this way helped me seeing/understanding a bit what happens under the hood, it was actually a fun exercise!)

\
Other aspects I'd like to mention are:
 - Most of the UI designs are taken from the course, the HTML/CSS was also done very similarly to the course, although I made my personal adjustments and improvements. What is 100% completely mine is the files structure, the javascript/react and all the related aspects
- I use the `React.createElement` function throughout the project, I know I could just assign it to a shorthard (as mentioned in the react doc page mentioned above), but as a personal preference I decided to leave it as it is (in my opinion this makes the code a bit clearer)
